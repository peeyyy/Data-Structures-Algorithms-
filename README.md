#### Good day. Welcome to my Data Structures & Algorithms.
  > - The folder _**LAB01**_ contains the file of codes for solving and graphing the mathematical function which is named `main.py`.
  > - The text file named `data_num.txt` contains the x-values from 1-50.
  > - The `function_result.txt` contains the results from the given mathematical function.
  > - The _**LIST OF GRAPHS**_ folder contained the screenshots of graphs from 1st function to the combination of all functions.

The uploaded file `main.py` is a Python script that plots various mathematical functions. Here’s a brief description:

- The script first prompts the user to choose a mathematical function from a list of 11 options.

   -   **_LIST OF FUNCTIONS:_**
> -   1.) f(x) = x^2 + 7x + 2
> -   2.) f(x) = 3x + 2
> -   3.) f(x) = x^2
> -   4.) f(x) = x^3
> -   5.) f(x) = x^5
> -   6.) f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 10
> -   7.) f(x) = x^4 - 3x^3 + 2x^2 - x + 11
> -   8.) f(x) = sin(x)
> -   9.) f(x) = cos(x)
> -   10.) f(x) = x^5 + 4x^4 + x^3 - 2x^2 + 100
> -   11.) To plot all functions.
- The chosen function(s) are then evaluated for a range of x-values read from a file named `data_num.txt`.
- The results are written to a file named `function_result.txt`.
- Finally, the results are read from `function_result.txt` and plotted using matplotlib.

The mathematical functions include quadratic, cubic, quintic equations, sine, cosine functions, and more. The script uses Python’s built-in `math` module for mathematical operations and `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting. The `ast.literal_eval()` function is used to interpret the results read from the file as Python literals. This script is a good example of how Python can be used for mathematical computations and data visualization.
